This code is to model ideal flow of packets on Cray's XC30.

Limitation: can be run on at max 16,384 MPI ranks. The primes.h file has limited
number of entries. Simulated cores can be as many as desired.

Code is a bit messed up..different branches of the repo simulates different
scenarios. Hopefully, this will be cleaned up with time.

Branch biased-only is currently active and should be closest to real machine's
behavior.

Compilation:
1. Create a build dir and cd into it.
2. Inside the build dir, do following:
cmake ..
make

Run Command:

mpirun -np 8 ./ariesModeling conffile map_file out_file

conffile - configuration file (format described below)
map_file - if non-existent, default is used (Blue Gene style, i.e. coordinates
in each line represents a rank; first "n1" ranks assumed for job 1, next "n2"
ranks assumed for job 2, etc.)
out_file - generated, contains the bytes on links

Format of conffile:
#total number of routers
#groups #rows #columns #nodes #cores
filename for intra group connection (binary format)
filename for inter group connection (binary format)
filename #ranks #edges (binary)
filename #ranks #edges (binary)
... as many files as needed

---END of format for conffile

Code for generating sample connection and comm-graph files are in utils folder.
