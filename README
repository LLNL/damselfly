This code is to model ideal flow of packets on Cray's XC30.

Limitation: can be run on at max 16,384 MPI ranks. The primes.h file has limited 
number of entries. Simulated cores can be as many as desired.

Code is a bit messed up..different branches of the repo simulates different 
scenarios. Hopefully, this will be cleaned up with time.

Branch biased-only is currently active and should be closest to real machine's
behavior. 

The confformat file specifies the format for the configurtion file.
